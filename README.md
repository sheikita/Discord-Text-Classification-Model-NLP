# Springboard-Capstone-Project-2

The goal of the project is to build a classification model that will classify any new topic submission to the adequate category ( API, Account Server Management, Chat, Mobile, Merchandise, Other, Overlay and Game Store). 


Jupyter Notebook: Capstone Project 2- E2E Classification Model.ipynb contains code used to transform text data into their numerical representation, then apply supervised learning models that could learn. Tested different scenarios such as removing stopwords, tf-idf. 

Technologies Used
* NLP: NLTK, spacy 
* Modeling: Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest
